# [Projects](projects) | [About Me](about) | [Contact](contact)

## 👋 I’m an MSc student in Wireless Communication and RF Systems at Tampere University, with a strong interest in GNSS positioning, 5G/Cloud RAN, and machine learning for communication systems. I enjoy working across the full stack of modern telecom systems, from wireless physical layer concepts like 5G NR, OFDM, MIMO, and SDR to practical GNSS techniques such as PVT estimation, RTK/PPP, and jamming or spoofing detection, using tools like RTKLIB and the GNSS receiver.
## I am also proficient in Python, MATLAB, and C/C++, I’m comfortable working with Linux systems (RedHat and Debian), automating infrastructure with Ansible and Terraform, and deploying containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes on AWS, Azure, GCP, and CSC cloud platforms. I apply MLOps practices, including CI/CD pipelines and reproducible environments, to take models and services from experimentation to reliable deployment.
